1. To what extent did the Green Revolution contribute to India’s rise in life expectancy?
Analyze the timeline of increased food production alongside improvements in life expectancy to assess correlation.

2. Did health indicators (like infant mortality rate) begin improving significantly after the onset of the Green Revolution?
Compare infant mortality trends before and after 1965 to detect potential health benefits.

3. How did improvements in food grain production affect the affordability of essential food items?
Use CPI and income data to analyze if food became more economically accessible.

4. Was the nutritional quality of the Indian diet significantly enhanced by the Green Revolution?
Go beyond calories — analyze availability of proteins, milk, eggs, etc., and nutritional adequacy over time.

5. Did life expectancy increase equally across socioeconomic groups, or was the Green Revolution’s impact unequal?
Use proxies like per capita income or CPI to explore if benefits were inclusive.

6. Is there a time-lag relationship between the increase in food production and improvements in life expectancy?
Investigate whether health outcomes improved immediately or gradually following food gains.

7. Did India’s experience with food-led lifespan growth differ from other developing nations without a Green Revolution?
Compare India’s life expectancy trend with nations like Bangladesh or Pakistan.

8. Is there evidence that scientific methods (hybrid seeds, fertilizers) used in the Green Revolution caused unintended health or environmental risks?
Introduce arguments based on secondary sources, even if not fully backed by dataset.

9. How do public narratives around the Green Revolution (as a ‘lifesaver’) align with actual health and nutrition data?
Compare popular claims vs. data-backed findings. A critical thinking question.

10. Has India’s rising life expectancy come at the cost of environmental or nutritional trade-offs?
Discuss whether the quantity of food overshadowed quality or sustainability.
